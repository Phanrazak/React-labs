# React Labs
### This was a fork for ungraded projects during weeks 2 and 3 of the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate (Developing Front-End Apps with React) on Coursera <br>

This fork aims to teach the basics for how to make a simple todo list that accepts input and has buttons to add, delete and edit inputs.

This fork also teaches you how to make a counter that increases on button clicks. It teaches the basic of Actions, Reducers and Store and how it interacts with each other
